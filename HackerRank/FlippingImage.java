//Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.
//
//        To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].
//
//        To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            //loop through each row, doing the swap and invert the same time
